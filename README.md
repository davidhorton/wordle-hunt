# Wordle Hunt

I forked the Wordle code (before the NYT bought it) and made this version of the game for my
wife's birthday. The idea is that each word she solves leads her to an actual physical place
in the house. She then is supposed to find a code and input that into the screen to get to
the next clue. All of this is configurable in the config.js file.

Two ways to run this: just open the wordleHunt.js file in a browser or run `node server.js`
in the root of the project.
